Variable: A container use to store data temporary and varies that's why it is called variable.
Dynamic nature: it's not necessary when we store data in it and it does not change but it changes most of the time
value change multiple times

techniques of variables to name them:
standardly 3 cases:

snake_case: user_name, first_name

camelCase: userName, firstName

PascalCase: UserName, FirstName

Rules for naming variables in python

1). any variable that we create must start with letter(A-Z, a-z) or underscore(_). name, _name
2). Cannot start with number. (1name)invalid
3). Names can only contain letters, numbers and nderscore
4). Case Sensitive. FirstName ---> firstName(both are different variables).
5). Reserved words cannot be used as variables.
6). name of variable must be meaningfull.

Creating a variable:
name of variable
assignment operator(=)
value

name of variable = value
example:
fruit = apple
a = 10

different nature of data store in variables
integers values(..-2,-1,0,1,2,..)
float values(decimal numbers)(2.33369, -10.0)
string value(sequence of characters, enclosed with in single('') or double quotes(""))("Pakistan", "1234")
Boolean value(True, False)(used for conditions)
